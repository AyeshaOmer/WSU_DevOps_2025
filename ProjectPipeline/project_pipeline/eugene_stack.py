- To reference you code make sure you get it from AWS cdk links
- roles are needed later on 
- move constants from WHLambda to a constants.py file in module

- in the cloudwatch logs if it has start and end, it means the function is working


To create a dashboard:
- Lambda function, publish metrics to cloudwatch ( this has been done)
- Based on these metrics we want alarms ( set threshold for latency and availability 
    - if theshold is bellow 1 then website not avialble)
    - if latency is above x ammount, raise alarm
- From these alarms we want a simple notification service (email and sms stating that one of the metrics has an alarm)
    It also triggers another lambda (Dynamo DB), once it runs it writes alarm informaiton into Dynamo Database
- From these we want to log the information in a Dynamo DB ()

- Stack file contains all components of your infrastructure (alarms, lambda functions, synth, dynamo DB) not your metrics as thats on lambda 
- Lambda is using SDK, stack file uses CDK
- Make it reference using one namespace

- We currently have custom metrics


Metric: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/python/aws_cdk.aws_cloudwatch/Metric.html

# Create a metric
metric = cloudwatch.Metric(
    namespace="AWS/EC2",
    metric_name="CPUUtilization",
    statistic="Average",
    period=Duration.minutes(5)
)

In Boto3 the dimentiosn is a list of dictionaries

'''
26/8/25
- Publish metrics -> alarms -> notification service (email and sms) -> 
Lambda or EC2 to write to the databse about the alarms/metrics-> Dynamo DB (no sequal database)

- Lambda is used as it should only be triggered when an alarm is sent off, and not needed to run all the time


SMS:
- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/python/aws_cdk.aws_sns/Topic.html
- Create a topic: everyone that subscribes to this topic will get a message when an alarm is sent off

topic = sns.Topic(self, "AlarmNotification", display_name="Alarm Notification Topic")
- give is a display name
- for the topic_names or names in general, if AWS already does it for you, then you don't need to give it a name


https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/python/aws_cdk.aws_sns/Subscription.html
bellow the alarms function do avail_alarm.add_alarm_action("insert topic here")


Write information into database:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/python/aws_cdk.aws_sns_subscriptions/EmailSubscription.html
- subscription target: sends alarm message to email address and lambda function, so we need another lambda function for SNS topic

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/python/aws_cdk.aws_sns_subscriptions/LambdaSubscription.html
- Create a new lambda function bellow the WHLambda function above. Call it DBLambda

- create a new dynamo DB role to give full access, we don't need a lambda role as it has already been done

- Dynamo DB will created in a stack file as its apart of your infrastructure

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/python/aws_cdk.aws_dynamodb/README.html

 We we are at so far:
- Lambda function to publish metrics to cloudwatch (done)
- Create threshold for the metrics to trigger alarms (done)
- SNS is triggered once it goes past the threshold, if it goes back to normal no sns is triggered, only once it breaks the threshold
- SNS topic is created in stack file (emails, sms)
- Lambda function created in stack to write alarm information into Dynamo DB
- Dynamo DB table is created in the stack file, but to write to the database create a lambda file
- The dynamo DB table is created in stack file as if we did in lambda file then we would create the same table over and over again
    - environment variables

- 




'''
'''
Feedback for work so far: 26/8/25
- read me file think of it as a user manual from the perspective of a user
- think about how response size is helpful in monitoring website health
- move websites to constants file as that is used in multiple files

Pipeline stuff:
go to here https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/python/aws_cdk.pipelines.html


Code for the pipeline: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/python/aws_cdk.pipelines/CodePipeline.html
Code for Pipeline Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/python/aws_cdk.pipelines/CodePipelineSource.html

create a new file for stack file so do mikdir, cd PipelineSprint. Folow rest of commands from project setup:
    - npm install -g aws-cdk
    - git clone <repo>
    - mkdir <your_name>
    - cd <your_name>
    - cdk init --language python
    - source .venv/bin/activate
    - python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

In the pipelie stack code:
- source = pipelines.CodePipelineSource.git_hub("owner/repo", "main", authentication, trigger)
- for authentication we need to go into the github repository, go to settings -> developer settings -> personal access tokens -> tokens (classic) -> generate new token
    - the token is only shown once so copy it into notes
- Trigger: make it a poll

import aws_codePilepline

source = pipeline.CodePipelineSource.git)hub( # look up the reference for this part
    repo_string "EugeneKosiak/WSU_DevOps_2025" # repo string
    branch = "main"
    action_name = :WSU_DeveOps_2025" # repo name
    authentication = SecretValue.secrets_manager("insert name given to token here - the link bellow"),
    trigger = GitHubTrigger('POLL') # Poll checks repo to see if there are any changes
    )

in this link: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/secretsmanager/create-secret.html follow, this would be inputed into the terminal
    aws secretsmanager create-secret \
        --name MyTestSecret \
        --secret-string file://mycreds.json

Shell Step:
- take the code and build it

    synth=pipelines.ShellStep("Synth",
        input=source,
        commands=['npm install -g aws-cdk','cd <>', 'python -m pip install -r requirements.txt', 'cdk synth'],
            # this part 'npm install -g aws-cdk', it depends, just do trial and error
        env={
            "COMMIT_ID": source.source_attribute("CommitId")
        }
    )
    # import pipelines as pipelines
    pipeline = pipelines.CodePipeline(scope, "EugnenPipeline",
        synth=synth)


steps:
- source, synth, pipeline, add_stage. Unit tests will be done next week
